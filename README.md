# Loan-payments-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the important steps in the data analysis process. Here, the focus is on making sense of the data in hand â€“ things like formulating the correct questions to ask to your dataset, how to manipulate the data sources to get the required answers, and others. This is done by taking an elaborate look at trends, patterns, and outliers using a visual method.
The current data set includes details of the 500 people who have opted for loan. Also, the data mentions whether the person has paid back the loan or not and if paid, in how many days they have paid. In this project, we will try to draw few insights on sample Loan data.
